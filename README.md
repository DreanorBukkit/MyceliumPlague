MyceliumPlague
==============

Mycelium Plague will infest your whole world and change Grass and Dirt Blocks to Mycelium and also change it's Biome to Mushroom Island.

The Plague will only spread if you manually place a Mycelium block and it carrys on to all Grass and Dirt blocks that it can reach over time. There are no Permissions, no Configurations or any Commands needed for the plugin.

## Features
* Place a Mycelium block anywhere to spread a plague
* Add new blocks to the config that should be affected by the plague.
* Admins can rollback everything with /rollback (Command name will be changed soon)
